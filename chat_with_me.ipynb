      "The algorithm is a machine that is written to carry out a specific task. It is a set of instructions that a computer or a machine can execute. The instructions are designed to perform a specific job and are usually written in a programming language. Programming languages are used to give instructions to a machine in order to carry out a specific task. Algorithms are the fundamental component of programming languages and are used to define the logic of the program. A program is only a collection of algorithms and instructions that are given to the machine. The machine will execute the algorithms and instructions given to it in order to achieve its purpose. Programming is an essential part of the job of a computer or a machine. It allows it to do its job and carry out complex tasks. It also allows it to automate and speed up processes. Programming can be both a source of complex logic and a source of errors if not handled properly. It is important to have a good understanding of the subject before starting to code. Take a break and allow your brain to rest and regrow. Programming is a rewarding and challenging occupation. It allows you to do something you may not have been able to do before.
